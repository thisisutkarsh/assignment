# Todo App

My first web page using react with a dark mode design.

Link to the [todoapp](https://thisisutkarsh.github.io/todoapp/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
